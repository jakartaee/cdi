/**
 * Includes logic for determining when an asynchronous action started by an invocation
 * of an asynchronous method completes. Service providers of this interface are called
 * <em>async handlers</em>. For the purpose of method invokers, a method is called
 * <em>asynchronous</em> if it matches an async handler.
 * <p>
 * An <em>async type</em> of an async handler is the erasure of the type argument
 * to the {@code AsyncHandler} direct superinterface type.
 * <p>
 * An async handler must be annotated either {@link ReturnType} or {@link ParameterType}.
 * This annotation determines how methods are matched and how the async handler is used.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #transform(Object, Runnable) transform()} method of a matching async handler
 * is called exactly once by {@link Invoker#invoke(Object, Object[]) Invoker.invoke()}.
 * It takes an {@code original} asynchronous action and returns a transformation of it.
 * This transformation calls {@code completion.run()} exactly once, when the asynchronous
 * action completes.
 * <p>
 * For example, an async handler for {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage} may look like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;AsyncReturnType
 * public class CompletionStageAsyncHandler&lt;T&gt; implements AsyncHandler&lt;CompletionStage&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
 *     public CompletionStage&lt;T&gt; transform(CompletionStage&lt;T&gt; original, Runnable completion) {
 *         return original.whenComplete((value, error) -> {
 *             completion.run();
 *         });
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The CDI container must provide an async handler for the return types of
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage CompletionStage},
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture CompletableFuture} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher Flow.Publisher}.
 * These are used by passing {@code AsyncHandler.CompletionStage.class},
 * {@code AsyncHandler.CompletableFuture.class} or {@code AsyncHandler.FlowPublisher.class},
 * respectively, to {@link InvokerBuilder#withAsync(Class)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type that represents the asynchronous action
 */
