/**
 * <p>
 * Provides an operation for obtaining and destroying contextual instances with a particular scope of any contextual type. Any
 * instance of {@code Context} is called a context object.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link AlterableContext} was introduced in CDI 1.1 to allow bean instances to be destroyed by the application. Extensions
 * should implement {@link AlterableContext} instead of {@link Context}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The context object is responsible for creating and destroying contextual instances by calling operations of
 * {@link Contextual}. In particular, the context object is responsible for destroying any
 * contextual instance it creates by passing the instance to
 * {@link Contextual#destroy(Object, CreationalContext)} . A destroyed instance must not
 * subsequently be returned by {@code get()}. The context object must pass the same instance of
 * {@link CreationalContext} to {@code Contextual.destroy()} that it passed to
 * {@code Contextual.create()} when it created the instance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A custom context object may be registered with the container using
 * {@link AfterBeanDiscovery#addContext(Context)}.
