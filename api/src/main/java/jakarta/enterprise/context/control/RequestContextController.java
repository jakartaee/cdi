 * The CDI container provides a built-in instance of {@code RequestContextController} that is dependent scoped for the purposes
 * of activating and deactivating. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject
 * private RequestContextController requestContextController;
 *
 * public void doRequest(String body) {
 *     // activate request context
 *     boolean activated = requestContextController.activate();
 *     try {
 *         // do work in a request context.
 *     } finally {
 *         // deactivate the request context if we activated it earlier
 *         if (activated) {
 *             requestContextController.deactivate();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Once the request context has been deactivated, you may activate it once again, creating a brand new request context.
 * The activated request context is bound to the current thread, any injection points targeting a request scoped bean
 * will be satisfied with the same request scoped objects.
