/**
 * The container provides a built in interceptor that may be used to annotate classes and methods to indicate
 * that a request context should be activated when this method is invoked.
 *
 * The request context will be activated before the method is called, and deactivated when the method invocation is
 * complete (regardless of any exceptions being thrown).  If the context is already active, it is ignored, neither
 * activated nor deactivated.
