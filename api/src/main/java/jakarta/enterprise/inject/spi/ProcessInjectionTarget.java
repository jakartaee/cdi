 * The container fires an event of this type for every Java EE component class supporting injection that may be instantiated by
 * the container at runtime, including every managed bean declared using {@code jakarta.annotation.ManagedBean}, EJB session or
 * message-driven bean, enabled bean, enabled interceptor or enabled decorator.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any observer of this event is permitted to wrap and/or replace the {@link InjectionTarget}. The
 * container must use the final value of this property, after all observers have been called, whenever it performs injection
 * upon the managed bean, session bean or other Java EE component class supporting injection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this observer decorates the {@code InjectionTarget} for all servlets.

 * <pre>
 * public &lt;T extends Servlet&gt; void decorateServlet(@Observes ProcessInjectionTarget&lt;T&gt; pit) {
 *     pit.setInjectionTarget(decorate(pit.getInjectionTarget()));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If any observer method of a {@code ProcessInjectionTarget} event throws an exception, the exception is treated as a
 * definition error by the container.
