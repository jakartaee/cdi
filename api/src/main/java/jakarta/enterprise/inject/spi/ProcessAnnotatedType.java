/**
 * <p>
 * The container fires an event of this type for each Java class or interface it discovers in a bean archive, before it reads
 * the declared annotations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any observer of this event is permitted to wrap and/or replace the {@link AnnotatedType} by calling either
 * {@link #setAnnotatedType(AnnotatedType)} or {@link #configureAnnotatedType()}.
 * If both methods are called within an observer notification an {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown.
 * The container must use the final value of this property, after all observers have been called, to discover the types and read
 * the annotations of the program elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the following observer decorates the {@link AnnotatedType} for every class that is
 * discovered by the container.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public &lt;T&gt; void decorateAnnotatedType(@Observes ProcessAnnotatedType&lt;T&gt; pat) {
 *     pat.setAnnotatedType(decorate(pat.getAnnotatedType()));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If any observer method of a {@code ProcessAnnotatedType} event throws an exception, the exception is treated as a definition
 * error by the container.
