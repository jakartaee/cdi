 * The container fires an event of this type for each {@linkplain Produces producer method or field} of
 * each enabled bean, including resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any observer of this event is permitted to wrap and/or replace the {@code Producer} by calling either
 * {@link #setProducer(Producer)} or {@link #configureProducer()}. If both methods are called within an observer notification an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown. The container must use the final value of this property, after all observers have
 * been called, whenever it calls the producer or disposer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this observer decorates the {@code Producer} for the all producer methods and field of type
 * {@code EntityManager}.

 * <pre>
 * void decorateEntityManager(@Observes ProcessProducer&lt;?, EntityManager&gt; pp) {

 * If any observer method of a {@code ProcessProducer} event throws an exception, the exception is treated as a definition error
 * by the container.
