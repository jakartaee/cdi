/**
 * <p>
 * Specifies that an annotation type is a stereotype.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In many systems, use of architectural patterns produces a set of recurring bean roles. A stereotype allows a framework
 * developer to identify such a role and declare some common metadata for beans with that role in a central place.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bean may declare zero, one or multiple stereotypes, by applying the stereotype annotation to the bean class or producer
 * method or field.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A stereotype encapsulates any combination of:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>a default scope, and</li>
 * <li>a set of interceptor bindings.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The default scope of a stereotype is defined by annotating the stereotype with a scope type. A stereotype may declare at most
 * one scope. If a bean explicitly declares a scope, any default scopes declared by its stereotypes are ignored.

 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The interceptor bindings of a stereotype are defined by annotating the stereotype with the interceptor binding types. A
 * stereotype may declare zero, one or multiple interceptor bindings. An interceptor binding declared by a stereotype is
 * inherited by any bean that declares that stereotype.

 * A stereotype may also specify that:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>all beans with the stereotype have defaulted bean EL names, or that</li>
 * <li>all beans with the stereotype are alternatives.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A stereotype may declare an empty {@link jakarta.inject.Named &#064;Named} annotation, which specifies that every bean with the
 * stereotype has a defaulted name when a name is not explicitly specified by the bean.

 * A stereotype may declare other stereotypes. Stereotype declarations are transitive. A stereotype declared by a second
 * stereotype is inherited by all beans and other stereotypes that declare the second stereotype.
