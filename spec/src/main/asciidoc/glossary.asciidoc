This glossary includes terms used throughout the CDI specification that are either defined in other specifications, in which case links are provided, or are used in the CDI specification but not defined precisely, in which case the terms are defined here.
Under no circumstances should the definitions here be interpreted as affecting other specifications that might use the same terms.

WARNING: The glossary is very much not complete at the moment.
Completing it is work in progress.

// please keep the following list in alphabetical order

Actual type:: A type that does not contain wildcard types or type variables. Specifically, an _actual type_ is:

* a primitive type,
* a class type, including raw types,
* an array type, if the component type is an actual type,
* a parameterized type, if all type arguments are actual types.

Direct superclass type:: link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.4[JLS 8.1.4]

Direct superinterface type:: link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.5[JLS 8.1.5] and link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.3[JLS 9.1.3]

Superclass:: link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.4[JLS 8.1.4]

Superclass type:: The _superclass type_ relationship is the transitive closure of the _direct superclass type_ relationship.
