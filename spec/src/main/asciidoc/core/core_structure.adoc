== Structure

The Core CDI specification has two subparts:

* {cdi_lite} specification which contains a subset of CDI features and which can be implemented in more restricted environments; this is part of the Jakarta EE Core Profile;
* {cdi_full} specification that builds on top of Lite and adds all advanced CDI features; this is the classic CDI platform that is part of the Jakarta EE Web Profile and Jakarta EE Platform.
