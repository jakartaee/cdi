=== Building an `Invoker` in {cdi_full}

In addition to rules defined in <<building_invoker>>, the following rules apply.

When the target bean is a decorator, attempting to build an invoker leads to a deployment problem.

[[invoker_builder_full]]
=== Using `InvokerBuilder` in {cdi_full}

In addition to rules defined in <<invoker_builder>>, the following rules apply.

`InvokerBuilder` can be obtained in portable extensions from `ProcessManagedBean.createInvoker()`:

[source,java]
----
public interface ProcessManagedBean<X> extends ProcessBean<X> {
    ...

    InvokerBuilder<Invoker<X, ?>> createInvoker(AnnotatedMethod<? super X> method);
}
----

The target bean of the created invoker is the bean for which the `ProcessManagedBean` event was fired.
The target method of the created invoker is the method represented by the `AnnotatedMethod` object passed to `createInvoker()`.

Calling `InvokerBuilder.build()` produces an `Invoker` which should be stored for usage at application runtime.
