    <title>Normal scopes and pseudo-scopes</title>

    <para>Most scopes are <emphasis>normal scopes</emphasis>. The context object
    for a normal scope type is a mapping from each contextual type with that scope 
    to an instance of that contextual type. There may be no more than one mapped 
    instance per contextual type per thread. The set of all mapped instances of 
    contextual types with a certain scope for a certain thread is called the 
    <emphasis>context</emphasis> for that scope associated with that thread.</para>
    
    <para>A context may be associated with one or more threads. A context with a 
    certain scope is said to <emphasis>propagate</emphasis> from one point in the 
    execution of the program to another when the set of mapped instances of contextual
    types with that scope is preserved.</para>
    
    <para>The context associated with the current thread is called the 
    <emphasis>current context</emphasis> for the scope. The mapped instance of a 
    contextual type associated with a current context is called the <emphasis>current 
    instance</emphasis> of the contextual type.</para>
        
    <para>The <literal>get()</literal> operation of the context object for an 
    active normal scope returns the current instance of the given contextual 
    type.</para>
    
    <para>At certain points in the execution of the program a context may be 
    <emphasis>destroyed</emphasis>. When a context is destroyed, all mapped 
    instances belonging to that context are destroyed by passing them to the 
    <literal>Contextual.destroy()</literal> method.</para>

    has an injection point <literal>x</literal>, and <literal>B</literal> has 
    an injection point <literal>y</literal>. Suppose further that both 
    <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal> resolve to bean 
    <literal>Z</literal> according to the rules of typesafe resolution. If 
    <literal>a</literal> is the current instance of <literal>A</literal>, and 
    <literal>b</literal> is the current instance of <literal>B</literal>, then 
    both <literal>a.x</literal> and <literal>b.y</literal> refer to the same 
    instance of <literal>Z</literal>. This instance is the current instance of 
    <literal>Z</literal>.</emphasis></para>
  
    <para>Any scope that is not a normal scope is called a 
    <emphasis>pseudo-scope</emphasis>. The concept of a current instance is
    not well-defined in the case of a pseudo-scope.</para>

      <title>Conversation context lifecycle</title>

      <para>The <emphasis>conversation context</emphasis> is provided by a 
      built-in context object for the built-in passivating scope type 
      <literal>@ConversationScoped</literal>. The conversation scope is 
      active during all Servlet requests.</para>
      
      <para>An event with the <literal>ServletRequestEvent</literal> as the payload and with qualifier 
      <literal>@Initialized(ConversationScoped.class)</literal> is fired when the 
      conversation context is initialized and an event with qualifier 
      <literal>@Destroyed(ConversationScoped.class)</literal> when the conversation context
      is destroyed.</para>

      <para>The conversation context provides access to state associated with 
      a particular <emphasis>conversation</emphasis>. Every Servlet request has an
      associated conversation. This association is managed automatically by
      the container according to the following rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Any Servlet request has exactly one associated conversation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The conversation associated with a Servlet request is determined at 
          the beginning of the request before calling any <literal>service()</literal>
          method of any servlet in the web application, calling the
          <literal>doFilter()</literal> method of any servlet filter in the web application
          and before the container calls any <literal>ServletRequestListener</literal> 
          or <literal>AsyncListener</literal> in the web application.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Any conversation is in one of two states: <emphasis>transient</emphasis> 
      or <emphasis>long-running</emphasis>.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>By default, a conversation is transient</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A transient conversation may be marked long-running by calling

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>All long-running conversations have a string-valued unique 
      identifier, which may be set by the application when the conversation
      is marked long-running, or generated by the container.</para>

      <para>If the conversation associated with the current Servlet request is in
      the <emphasis>transient</emphasis> state at the end of a Servlet request, it
      is destroyed, and the conversation context is also destroyed.</para>

      <para>If the conversation associated with the current Servlet request is in
      the <emphasis>long-running</emphasis> state at the end of a Servlet request,
      it is not destroyed. The long-running conversation associated with a request 
      may be propagated to any Servlet request via use of a GET request parameter 
      named <literal>cid</literal> containing the unique identifier of the 
      conversation. In this case, the application must manage this request 
      parameter.</para>
      
      
      <para>If the current Servlet request is a JSF request, and the conversation 
      is in <emphasis>long-running</emphasis> state, it is propagated according 
      to the following rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The long-running conversation context associated with a
          request that renders a JSF view is automatically propagated to any
          faces request (JSF form submission) that originates from that
          rendered page.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The long-running conversation context associated with a
          request that results in a JSF redirect (a redirect resulting from a 
          navigation rule or JSF <literal>NavigationHandler</literal>) is
          automatically propagated to the resulting non-faces request, and to
          any other subsequent request to the same URL. This is accomplished
          via use of a GET request parameter named <literal>cid</literal> 
          containing the unique identifier of the conversation.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>When no conversation is propagated to a Servlet request, the request is 
      associated with a new transient conversation.</para>

      <para>All long-running conversations are scoped to a particular HTTP 
      servlet session and may not cross session boundaries.</para>
      
      <para>In the following cases, a propagated long-running conversation cannot 
      be restored and reassociated with the request:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>When the HTTP servlet session is invalidated, all long-running
          conversation contexts created during the current session are destroyed, 
          after the servlet <literal>service()</literal> method completes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The container is permitted to arbitrarily destroy any long-running 
          conversation that is associated with no current Servlet request, in order to 
          conserve resources.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The <emphasis>conversation timeout</emphasis>, which may be specified
      by calling <literal>Conversation.setTimeout()</literal> is a hint to the 
      container that a conversation should not be destroyed if it has been active 
      within the last given interval in milliseconds.</para>
      
      <para>If the propagated conversation cannot be restored, the container must 
      associate the request with a new transient conversation and throw an 
      exception of type 
      <literal>javax.enterprise.context.NonexistentConversationException</literal>.</para>
      
      <para>The container ensures that a long-running conversation may be 
      associated with at most one request at a time, by blocking or rejecting 
      concurrent requests. If the container rejects a request, it must associate
      the request with a new transient conversation and throw an exception of type 
      <literal>javax.enterprise.context.BusyConversationException</literal>.</para>
