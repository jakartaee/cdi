 * A class. Five kinds of classes are distinguished:

 * <li>interfaces</li>
 * <li>enums (restricted kind of classes)</li>
 * <li>annotations (specialized kind of interfaces)</li>
 * <li>records (restricted kind of classes)</li>
 * </ul>

 * Classes are represented as isolated units. That is, if this class is nested, it is not possible
 * to obtain the enclosing class. Similarly, it is not possible to obtain the set of classes
 * nested in this class.
 * <p>
 * At the same time, it is possible to obtain the set of {@linkplain #constructors() constructors},
 * {@linkplain #methods() methods} and {@linkplain #fields() fields} declared in this class, as well
 * as the set of {@linkplain #recordComponents() record components} if this class is a record.
 * It is also possible to obtain the {@linkplain #packageInfo() package} this class is declared in.
