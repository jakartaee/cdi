<p>Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines a set of 
complementary services that help improve the structure of application
code.</p>

<p>Core CDI specification is split into Lite and Full. Lite includes
most of the features and is tailored for runtimes that don't intend
to implement the entire Jakarta EE platform. Full includes features
that are not deemed necessary for all CDI implementations. Jakarta EE
implementations are required to support Full.
Lite adds additional APIs to support build-time generators and is not required to be implemented with Full.
